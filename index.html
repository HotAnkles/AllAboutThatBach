                  This website represents my second run-through of Free Code Camp. I first began this process in March of 2016 and lost momentum due to teaching commitments and time constraints. Over the past week or so I have returned to this project and finally begun gaining momentum. I really hope that, in addition to a clean website, this provides the reader with some interesting content. <br>
                  Regarding the content, I have been interested in Johann Sebastian Bach since high school when I bought a CD with music of his from a thrift store. During my first few years after high school I started to learn more about his music and was exposed to his collections of preludes and fugues, books 1 and 2 of The Well Tempered Clavier. These fugues were made up of different melodic lines, different voices, that supported and highlighted one another, that came together in the most intricate combinations to create music that was so much more than the sum of its parts. Eventually, through a recording of his Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, I was exposed to more of his keyboard music, more specifically, his organ music. Like the fugues from the WTC collections, his organ music was made up of this intricate combinations of melodic lines. The function of much of this music, however, was completely different. Many of these pieces were based on preexisting songs, hymns and melodies commonly heard in church that no doubt held great significance to Bach and others in his community. This music made its way into nearly every aspect of Bach’s music, most significantly, his sacred vocal music, music for use in the church.

                  From his church cantatas to his motets and “motet-like” music, to his passions, mass fragments, and complete mass setting, this music provided the backbone and scaffolding for much of his finest music. This website seeks to shed a small bit of light on the above mentioned topics and provide resources for those interested in knowing more.

                Johann Sebastian Bach, 1685-1750, was born in Eisenach and came from a family with a rich musical background. His musical instruction came from his father and uncles. By 1703, Bach had accepted his first position as a chapel musician for Duke Johann Ernst III in Weimar. In addition to composing for the church, Bach also composed a great deal of music for other occasions and purposes for a variety of instruments. This music included collections of music for different solo instruments and combinations of instruments in small and large scales. Solo instruments and small ensembles were often referred to as sonatas, and music for larger ensembles featuring solo instruments were referred to as concertos. In addition to this instrumental music, Bach also wrote vocal music not intended to be used in the church, various secular cantatas. Focusing on sacred music, however, leads us first to Bach’s church cantatas.

              Starting from the end of Bach’s life finds us in Leipzig which is where he wrote some of his finest music for the church. Bach was appointed the position of Thomaskantor, the musical director for the St. Thomas church in Leipzig in 1723. In this role, Bach was expected to provide music for the church in the form of a cantata for every Sunday and major festival day. These cantatas called for a variety of forces including solo voices and small instrumental ensembles to full orchestras and choirs. While in Leipzig, Bach wrote three collections of cantatas for the entire church year. <br>
